            <li>finely chopped chives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> For the lobster an sauce: Bring a large stockpot filled three-quarters of the way with water to a rolling boil over high heat.<br> 
                 Add the lobsters to the pot, making sure that each lobster is completely submerged.<br> 
                 Cook the lobsters until they are bright red, about 8 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li> For the mac and cheese: Add the 1 quart heavy cream, Parmesan, Dijon, Worcestershire, pepper and a pinch of salt <br>
                 to a large skillet over medium heat.<br>Simmer gently, whisking until smooth. Add the Gruyere and turn off the heat.<br>
                 Carefully stir and let melt. Taste for seasoning and stir occasionally until melted and smooth.</li>
            <li> Bring 4 quarts water to a rolling boil in a large pot over medium heat. Add salt and bring the water back to a boil.<br>
                 Add the macaroni and stir with a wooden spoon to ensure the macaroni does not stick to the bottom of the pot.<br>
                 Cook until the macaroni is still quite firm, about 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to a glass bowl. Add the cheese sauce and stir to combine; keep warm.</li>
            <li> Carefully remove the lobster meat from the tails, claws and legs, taking care to remove any cartilage from the claw meat.<br>
                 Cut the meat into bite-size pieces, put in a medium bowl and then season with a pinch of salt. Discard the tail and body shells but keep the heads. <br>
                 Cut the heads in half.</li>
            <li> For the lobster sauce: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook until tender, about 4 minutes,<br>
                 then add the head halves and steam in the shallot butter, about 3 minutes. Carefully add the cognac and cook down until there is very little liquid<br>
                 left in the skillet, 2 to 3 minutes, then add the shrimp stock. Raise the heat to high and cook until reduced by about half, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> Add the 1/2 cup heavy cream and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stir to combine and return to a simmer until the butter melts, then remove from heat.<br>
                 Add the lemon juice, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and add the chopped tarragon. Add the lobster and gently toss to fully coat.<br>
                 Season to taste with salt.</li>
            <li> Fill serving bowls halfway with macaroni and cheese and top with the lobster and sauce. Repeat with another layer of macaroni and top with the remaining lobster and sauce.<br>
                 Finish with a pinch of salt.</li>
        </ol>
